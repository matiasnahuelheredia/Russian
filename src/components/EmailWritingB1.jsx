      email: `Dear Hotel Manager,

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with my recent stay at your hotel from November 15th to 18th. I was staying in room 305 and unfortunately experienced several problems during my visit.

Firstly, the air conditioning in my room was not working properly. Despite reporting this to reception on the first evening, it was not repaired until the third day of my stay. This made it very uncomfortable to sleep, especially given the warm weather.

Secondly, the room was not cleaned daily as promised. On two occasions, I returned to find my room had not been serviced at all. When I complained to the housekeeping staff, they apologized but the problem continued.

Finally, the hotel restaurant was closed on two evenings without prior notice, which was very inconvenient as I had specifically chosen your hotel for its dining facilities.

I have been a regular customer of your hotel chain for several years and this experience has been very disappointing. I would appreciate a response explaining what went wrong and what compensation you might offer.

I look forward to your reply.

Yours faithfully,
[Your name]`,

I am writing to request information about the English courses offered at your language school. I am particularly interested in improving my business English skills.

Could you please send me details about the following:

- The different course levels available
- The course schedule and duration
- The fees and payment options
- Whether there are any upcoming courses starting soon
- If you offer online or in-person classes

I currently work full-time, so I would prefer evening or weekend classes if possible. I would also like to know if you provide any placement tests to determine my current level.

Additionally, I would be grateful if you could inform me about the qualifications of your teachers and the average class size.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to receiving the information at your earliest convenience.

I just wanted to send you a quick message to say a huge thank you for helping me move last weekend. I honestly don't know what I would have done without you!

Carrying all those boxes up to the third floor was definitely not easy, and you made the whole process so much more bearable. Plus, you even helped me unpack the kitchen - you're a star!

I really appreciate you giving up your entire Saturday to help me out. I know you had other things you could have been doing.

I owe you big time! How about I cook you dinner next week? Let me know when you're free and I'll make your favorite pasta dish.

Thanks again for being such an amazing friend.

Speak soon!
