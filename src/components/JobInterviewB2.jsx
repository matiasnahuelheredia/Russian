      sampleAnswer:
        "I'd describe my leadership style as collaborative and empowering. I believe in setting clear goals and expectations, but then giving team members the autonomy to determine how best to achieve them. For example, when I led a project team last year, I made sure everyone understood the end goal, but I encouraged each person to leverage their unique strengths in their approach. I also make it a priority to have regular check-ins where team members feel comfortable sharing challenges. This approach led to higher engagement and we completed the project two weeks ahead of schedule. I adapt my style based on the situation – sometimes people need more guidance, other times they need space to innovate.",

Initially, tensions were high. I requested a private meeting where we could discuss our perspectives without interruption. I realized that her concerns about quality were valid, and she understood my pressure regarding deadlines. We compromised by creating a timeline that included thorough planning in the early stages but allowed for faster execution later. This not only resolved our conflict but actually resulted in a better project outcome. We've worked well together ever since, and I learned the value of seeking to understand before being understood.",

        "I actually perform quite well under pressure because I've developed strong organizational strategies. When facing tight deadlines, I first break down the project into smaller tasks and prioritize them based on impact and dependencies. I also communicate proactively with stakeholders about realistic timelines and potential trade-offs. For instance, last quarter I had to deliver a major presentation with only three days' notice because a colleague fell ill. I stayed focused, worked systematically through each section, and asked a teammate to review my work. I delivered the presentation successfully and received positive feedback from senior management. The key for me is staying organized, communicating clearly, and maintaining a problem-solving mindset rather than panicking.",

For major decisions, I start by gathering relevant data and seeking input from stakeholders who'll be affected. I consider multiple alternatives and weigh the pros and cons of each, thinking about both short-term and long-term implications. I also consider our resources and constraints. However, I recognize that sometimes you need to make decisions without perfect information. For example, when choosing between two vendors last year, I had limited time. I focused on the key criteria that mattered most – reliability, cost, and customer service – and made a confident decision based on those factors.
