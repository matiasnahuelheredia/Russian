I also love reading, particularly crime novels and thrillers. There's something about getting lost in a good book that just helps me switch off from work completely.

Saturday afternoons, I try to do something social, whether it's meeting friends for coffee, going to a gallery, or sometimes just having people over for dinner. Sundays are more laid-back for me. I usually have a lie-in, then spend the afternoon either exploring different neighborhoods in the city or working on personal projects.

However, I've also learned to really value my alone time. I need those quiet moments to recharge, reflect, and pursue individual interests like reading or practicing meditation.

It was something I'd been saving for since I started working, and honestly, there were times when it felt like an impossible dream, especially with rising property prices.

I've learned to recognize when \"good enough\" is actually sufficient and when perfectionism is adding value versus creating unnecessary delays. I'm actively working on this by setting clearer boundaries around revision cycles and trusting my initial judgment more. Another area I'm developing is public speaking.

          sampleAnswer:
            'Last year, I was leading a major campaign launch when our main designer unexpectedly left the company just two weeks before the deadline. We were already behind schedule, and losing our key creative resource felt like a disaster. I had to act quickly. First, I called an emergency meeting with the remaining team to reassess our priorities and see what could be delegated. I then reached out to my network and managed to find a freelance designer who could start immediately. However, bringing someone new up to speed so quickly was challenging. I created detailed briefs and held daily check-ins to ensure we stayed aligned. I also negotiated with the client to adjust some of the deliverables - being transparent about the situation actually strengthened our relationship. We ended up delivering the campaign only three days late, and the client was extremely understanding and happy with the results. The experience taught me the importance of having contingency plans and the value of honest communication, especially when things go wrong.',

Working with talented colleagues is another big motivator for me. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can both learn from others and share my own expertise. Recognition certainly matters to me too - not necessarily public praise, but knowing that my contributions are valued and that I'm trusted with increasing levels of responsibility.
